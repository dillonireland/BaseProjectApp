# BaseProjectApp
A base app skeleton for CS370 projects

There are several ways to use this as a starting point for your project:

## Branch off of master
Your team can create a `ProjectName` branch from `master`, and do work there.  
You can even branch off of branches!
- create a branch from `master` called `ProjectName` (or whatever you choose to call it)
- branch from `ProjectName`, do your work, merge back into `ProjectName`

_NOTE: DO NOT MERGE BACK INTO MASTER_

Generally speaking, since you are taking an existing project and _significantly_ 
modifying it and changing its purpose, it is more appropriate to fork the project.


## Fork the Repository
A [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) is a copy of a repository. 
> Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.  
> Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project 
> or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
You can fork to your own personal Github userspace, or create an organization for your team and fork it there.

### _Optional:_ Creating an organization
An organization is a convenient way of controlling multiple people's access
to a repository or group of repositories. You are already a part of the `CS-370-18`
organization. Follow the link below for instructions on creating an organization just 
for your project team.  
- [Creating Organizations](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/)  


### Forking a Repository
1. Navigate to this project's repository in GitHub (you probably are already here!)
1. Click the `Fork` button at the top of this page
1. Choose where you want to fork the repository to. This may be your personal GitHub
space, or if you've followed the instructions above to create an organization for 
your team it should show up here

Your fork now has its own space in GitHub.

At this point, all further work should be done in branches. _You don't need to fork again!_

You can now clone it and do all your work with no worry of affecting the original 
`BaseProjectApp` in any way. If the original "upstream" repository gets updated, it 
is possible to update your fork with those changes.


### Making the project yours
Now that you've created a fork and have your own separate, local version 
of this project, you may wish to make some changes:
